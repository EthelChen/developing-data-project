This shiny app introduces two simple examples of linear regression: simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.
The data we use is Boston dataset in the MASS R package.
On the left, you can choose which type of linear regression you want. 
Then you can submit the "Update" button to see the "summary" result on the right, which shows the information of the linear regressions.
For "simple", you are going to see the result of "medv~lstat";
For "multiple", you are going to see the result of "lstat+age".
